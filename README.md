The couch surfer robot is designed to navigate around a 1.7m by 0.7m couch starting from a corner on a white surface. Along its route, it interacts with the boxes that are flushed against the couch which come in various sizes. The minimum width of the boxes is 15cm width and 25cm length to account for the size of robot chassis. The couch surfer should autonomously navigates around the object and the count the number of white strips placed adjacent to the boxes. The number of stripes counted correspond to the box number. It then stop at the same white surface it started from. This is all sensor based, the robot cannot be pre-programmed to meet these objectives.
